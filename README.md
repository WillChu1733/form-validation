# Form Validation

Add some client-side validation to improve the user experience of this form and guide the users in how they should fill out the fields.

You are free to write this yourself by editing the markup and adding your CSS and JavaScript in the files provided (`you.js` and `you.css`), or you can rework this with a framework or library of your choice.

## Requirements

- All fields are required except for middle name
- Required fields shouldn't be able to submit a blank value
- Dates should be logical, i.e: a date of birth cannot be in the future
- Drivers license number doesn't need anything special - just cannot be blank

## Resources

[Material Design Bootstrap](https://mdbootstrap.com/legacy/4.3.2/) is the UI library used for this exercise, but you are welcome to use any resource on the web to help you.
